## What I learned and implemented
- A good place to have a media query between mobile and desktop is 768px, also 48em (which is better for accessibility).
- I am doing mobile-first development with a media query for desktop. When doing this, I do not need two media queries. I just need a media query for desktop that covers the changes from mobile.
- I am using `display: none` on elements between the media query so the navigation bar will change depending on the device.
- Sections will bleed into each other when using set height measurements like pixels. Using `height: 100%` is one way to resolve this issue.
- Creating multiple branches will create various pull requests. If I remain on the same branch and keep pushing, it will all go to the same pull request automatically. I approved my PRs in the order they were pushed from my local machine.
